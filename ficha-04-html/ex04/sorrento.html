        Sorrento, perched on the southwestern coast of Italy, serves as a
        delightful gateway to the Amalfi Coast. This charming town is known for
        its stunning views of the Bay of Naples, lemon groves, and an inviting
        old town filled with colorful buildings and lively streets. Sorrento is
        an excellent starting point for exploring the coastal gems, such as
        Positano and Amalfi, while offering its own unique blend of Italian
        charm, cuisine, and culture.
