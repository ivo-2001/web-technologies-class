        Perched high above the Amalfi Coast, Ravello is a serene oasis known for
        its panoramic views, historic churches, and vibrant cultural scene. The
        town's famous gardens at Villa Cimbrone and Villa Rufolo have long
        inspired artists and travelers. Ravello's annual festival is a cultural
        highlight, while its tranquil ambiance and fewer tourists make it an
        ideal destination for a peaceful Italian escape. Whether wandering
        through its charming streets, exploring historic sites, or enjoying the
        views, Ravello offers an intimate encounter with the Amalfi Coast's
        magic.
